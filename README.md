# hello_world
my first repository

Hi Guys,

this is my first repository. I am very curious about working with GitHub and explore the features of GitHub. I am studiyng Information Technology at the Leibniz University of Hanover. Although I am doing my Masters i am quite a noob programmer. But I learn pretty fast and I am a self- motivated personality which makes everything possible :-).
